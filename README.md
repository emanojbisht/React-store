### The React Product Listing and Shopping Cart App is a small-scale project developed using React, aimed at providing users with an efficient and feature-rich interface for browsing and purchasing products. The app utilizes RESTful APIs to fetch product data, which is then rendered dynamically in the user interface.

### The app employs React components to present the list of products, displaying essential information such as product names, images, and basic details. Users can interact with each product by clicking on it, triggering a modal that fetches and displays comprehensive information about the selected product, including price, description, and available sizes.

### A fundamental feature of the app is the ability to add products to the shopping cart. This functionality is implemented using state management in React, allowing users to select a specific size for a product and add it to their cart with a single click. The app enforces validation to ensure that only available sizes can be added to the cart.

### To enhance the shopping experience, the app incorporates a discount coupon system. Users have the option to apply a coupon code during the checkout process. The app validates the coupon code and adjusts the final total accordingly, providing users with the associated discount.

### Furthermore, the app offers comprehensive cart management capabilities. Users can remove a specific product from the cart, triggering an update to the total price calculation. Additionally, a feature is available to remove all products from the cart in one go, facilitating a streamlined process to start afresh or empty the cart when desired.

### The React Product Listing and Shopping Cart App leverages React's component-based architecture, API integration, state management, and event handling to deliver a seamless and responsive user experience. With its robust features, including modal-based product details, size-based cart addition, coupon application, and convenient cart management, the app offers a technically proficient solution for users seeking a flexible and interactive shopping platform.
